## Executive Summary

Safi Oil Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that enables home cooking oil consumers to measure remaining oil in their bottle using their phone camera and AI vision analysis. Accessed instantly via QR code printed on the bottle — no app store download required — the app photographs the bottle, estimates the fill level using an LLM vision API, and delivers the result in ml, tablespoons, and cups alongside nutritional facts for the estimated consumed amount.

The POC targets a single oil company's bottle lineup (2–3 SKUs, clear glass, known geometry), with the starting level anchored at a full bottle (100%). Volume is calculated client-side using pre-registered bottle geometry (cylinder/frustum math) rather than relying solely on LLM precision — giving ±15% accuracy on clear glass bottles. Every scan captures image + metadata + user feedback to a Cloudflare R2 training dataset for future model fine-tuning.

**Target users:** Health-conscious home cooks who want passive dietary awareness without manual measuring — particularly those tracking calorie or fat intake. Secondary stakeholder: the oil company, which gains customer engagement data and a direct digital touchpoint.

**Problem solved:** Consumers have no practical way to track how much oil they've consumed from a bottle. Visual estimation is unreliable, measuring before every use is disruptive, and no existing product bridges the gap between physical cooking and dietary tracking.

**Why now:** LLM vision APIs (Gemini 2.5 Flash) now have sufficient accuracy and low enough latency to make camera-based estimation viable as a consumer product. Free-tier infrastructure (Cloudflare, Gemini) makes the POC zero-cost.

### What Makes This Special

**The insight:** Every oil bottle has a defined geometry. The LLM estimates only a fill _percentage_ from the photo; precise volume is calculated deterministically client-side using known bottle dimensions. This hybrid approach (imprecise AI + precise math) achieves ±15% accuracy without requiring hardware or specialized CV models.

**The differentiator:** Zero friction. QR code on the bottle → camera open in 2 taps → result in under 8 seconds. No account, no download, no manual entry. The dietary insight arrives at the moment of maximum motivation — right after cooking.

**The long game:** Every scan is a labeled training example (image + LLM prediction + user correction). The POC is simultaneously a consumer product and a data collection engine. The system is designed to get smarter with use without requiring a separate data collection phase.

## Product Scope & Phased Roadmap

### MVP — POC v1 (Current Scope)

**Goal:** Prove the core assumption — _"An LLM can estimate fill level accurately enough to be useful for dietary tracking."_
**Resources:** 1 full-stack developer, 2–4 weeks, $0 infrastructure.

**Core user journey:**

> User scans QR on oil bottle → app opens pre-loaded with bottle context → user captures photo → AI estimates fill level → app displays remaining/consumed in ml/tbsp/cups + nutritional facts → user optionally submits accuracy feedback

**Must-have capabilities:**

| Capability                                | Rationale                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| QR deep link → PWA with SKU pre-loaded    | Core differentiator — zero-friction entry |
| Camera capture + image compression        | Core input                                |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash vision analysis (fill %) | The POC hypothesis                        |
| Volume calculation (ml → tbsp → cups)     | Core value output                         |
| Nutritional facts for consumed amount     | Core value output                         |
| Groq fallback if Gemini fails             | Single provider = unreliable POC          |
| User feedback prompt + Layer 1 validation | Training data collection + quality        |
| R2 scan image + metadata storage          | POC doubles as data collection engine     |
| 2–3 registered bottle SKUs (clear glass)  | Minimum to demonstrate the pattern        |
| CI/CD (GitHub Actions → Cloudflare)       | Maintainable deployment                   |

**Accepted POC constraints:** Starting level = 100% (full bottle); clear glass only; no user accounts; no admin dashboard; privacy notice as inline text.

**🚨 CRITICAL POC LIMITATION — Full Bottle Baseline:**

This POC assumes the user's first scan occurs when the bottle is brand new (100% full). The app tracks consumption from that baseline forward. This means:

- ✅ **Works:** User buys new bottle → scans QR immediately → uses app to track consumption over time
- ❌ **Doesn't work:** User buys bottle → uses some oil → then scans QR for first time → app has no baseline

**User-facing communication:** The app will display a clear notice on first scan: _"For accurate tracking, scan your bottle when it's brand new. This POC tracks consumption from a full bottle baseline."_

**Rationale:** Custom starting level requires either (a) manual user input ("My bottle is 60% full") which adds friction, or (b) AI estimation of absolute volume which is less accurate than percentage estimation. The POC prioritizes accuracy and zero-friction over flexibility.

**Phase 2 solution:** Allow users to set custom starting level with explicit accuracy trade-off messaging.

### Phase 2 — User Engagement (Post-POC Validation)

- User accounts (email/social login) + scan history timeline
- Custom starting level ("My bottle is already half used")
- Push notifications ("Time to restock?")
- Additional SKUs + admin dashboard for feedback review

### Phase 3 — Model Intelligence (100+ Scans)

- Prompt refinement from error pattern analysis (50+ scans)
- Few-shot examples in LLM prompt (100+ scans)
- Fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL 7B on validated pairs (500+ scans)
- Fine-tune Gemini Flash via Google AI Studio (1,000+ scans)
- Layer 2 statistical outlier detection on feedback

### Phase 4 — Platform Scale

- Native mobile app (React Native) — reliable iOS camera, offline scan
- Dynamic bottle shape detection for unregistered bottles
- Multi-brand open bottle registry API
- Barcode scanning (UPC — no QR required)
- Multi-language support

### Phase 5 — Business Intelligence

- Aggregated anonymized consumption analytics for the oil company
- Regional consumption pattern reports
- Product size optimization insights
- Loyalty program integration

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk Category | Risk                             | Mitigation                                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Technical     | LLM accuracy worse than ±15%     | Prompt refinement + few-shot examples as first lever                                           |
| Technical     | iOS camera reliability           | Safari browser mode hard constraint; baked into architecture                                   |
| Technical     | Gemini API latency > 8s          | `thinkingBudget: 0` + 800px compression; Groq fallback                                         |
| Market        | Users don't submit feedback      | 4-button UI (no slider for "About right"); incentive copy if rate < 20%                        |
| Market        | Client unsatisfied with accuracy | Set ±15% expectation before POC launch; frame as improving baseline                            |
| Resource      | Developer bandwidth              | Core value (QR → camera → result) achievable in ~1 week; CI/CD and Groq fallback are droppable |

## Domain-Specific Requirements

### Compliance & Regulatory

- No regulatory pathway required — not a medical device, diagnostic tool, or clinical product. No FDA 510(k), no HIPAA.
- USDA FoodData Central nutrition data is authoritative (CC0 license). App must display a disclaimer: results are **estimates**, not certified nutritional analysis.
- Scan images and metadata are stored for model training. A brief privacy notice is required before the user's first scan.
- No COPPA concerns — app does not target users under 13; no account creation.

### Technical Constraints

- **Accuracy framing:** ±15% is the honest ceiling for LLM vision on clear glass. UI must communicate this as an estimate, never a precise measurement.
- **iOS camera:** WebKit bug in standalone PWA mode (iOS 18.0–18.1). Hard constraint: Safari browser mode only. `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` must be absent. "Open in Safari" fallback required.
- **Network dependency:** Scan requires internet (Gemini API call). App shell loads offline; scan page must handle offline state with clear messaging.
- **Image storage:** Bottle photos stored in R2 may contain kitchen backgrounds. No PII directly captured, but must be disclosed in the privacy notice.

### Integration Requirements

| Integration           | Role                     | Notes                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash      | Primary vision provider  | `responseMimeType: 'application/json'`; `thinkingBudget: 0`          |
| Groq Llama 4 Scout    | Fallback vision provider | OpenAI-compatible; activates on Gemini 429/5xx                       |
| USDA FoodData Central | Nutrition data source    | Bundled as static JSON at build time; CC0 license; no live API calls |
| Cloudflare R2         | Scan storage             | Worker binding; zero egress fees                                     |

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### Detected Innovation Areas

**1. Hybrid AI + Geometry Measurement**
LLM estimates only fill _percentage_; precise volume is calculated deterministically from pre-registered bottle geometry. This achieves ±15% accuracy without demanding precision from the imprecise component — a deliberate separation of concerns. Distinct from pure LLM volume estimation (unreliable) and from CV depth-sensing (requires hardware).

**2. QR Code as Zero-Friction Entry Point**
The QR code on the physical product pre-loads all context (SKU, geometry, nutrition profile) before the user opens the camera. No installation, no account, no onboarding. Eliminates the largest drop-off point in consumer health apps: setup friction before first value delivery.

**3. POC as Training Data Engine**
Every scan generates a labeled training example (image + LLM prediction + user correction). Layer 1 validation ensures signal quality from day one. No separate data collection phase required — the product and the training pipeline are the same thing.

**4. Multi-Provider LLM Resilience at Edge**
Gemini → Groq fallback chain runs inside a Cloudflare Worker (zero cold starts, IP rate limiting, R2 binding). Keeps API keys server-side, provides graceful degradation, adds persistence — all without an application server.

### Competitive Landscape

- No direct competitor for AI-powered oil level tracking via QR + camera
- Manual log apps (MyFitnessPal) — high friction, no visual capture
- Smart kitchen hardware (connected scales) — requires hardware purchase
- Receipt-scanning apps — scan labels, not remaining content

Safi occupies an uncontested niche: **passive dietary tracking via product-embedded QR + AI vision, zero hardware**.

### Innovation Validation (POC)

| Aspect                      | Validation Method                        | Target        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Hybrid accuracy             | LLM fill% vs user corrections, ≥50 scans | MAE ≤ 15%     |
| Zero-friction entry         | Scan completion rate                     | ≥ 80%         |
| Feedback as training signal | Submission rate + acceptance rate        | ≥ 30% / ≥ 60% |
| Edge AI proxy latency       | Worker p95 latency                       | < 8 seconds   |

---

## PWA Requirements

### Architecture

Single-Page Application (SPA), `display: "browser"` — not `"standalone"`. Browser mode is mandatory for iOS camera compatibility (WebKit bug in standalone mode). Android gets full PWA capabilities including install prompt.

### Browser Support Matrix

| Platform | Browser             | Support Level                     |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Android  | Chrome 120+         | Full — primary target             |
| Android  | Firefox 120+        | Full                              |
| iOS      | Safari 17+          | Full (browser mode only)          |
| iOS      | Chrome (iOS)        | Partial — same WebKit constraints |
| Desktop  | Chrome/Firefox/Edge | Dev + QA only                     |

### PWA Manifest (Key Fields)

```json
{
  "display": "browser",
  "start_url": "/",
  "scope": "/"
}
```

`apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tag must be **absent**.

### Service Worker Caching

| Asset                                | Strategy               | Rationale                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| App shell (JS/CSS/HTML)              | CacheFirst             | Instant repeat loads      |
| API routes (`/analyze`, `/feedback`) | NetworkOnly            | Never cache LLM responses |
| Bottle images (`/bottles/*.png`)     | CacheFirst, 30-day TTL | Static assets             |

### Responsive Design

- Primary viewport: mobile portrait 375–430px
- Touch targets: ≥ 44×44px
- Camera viewfinder: full-screen on mobile
- Result display: single-scroll, no horizontal scroll
- No desktop-specific layouts required

### Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA — pragmatic POC implementation:

- Text contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1
- Touch targets ≥ 44×44px
- Error and status states conveyed via text + icon (not color alone)

### Security

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GROQ_API_KEY` stored only as Cloudflare Worker secrets — never in client code, git history, or `wrangler.toml`
- All Worker endpoints validate request origin against allowlist (production domain + localhost)
- Worker enforces ≤10 requests/IP/minute via KV-backed sliding window rate limiter
- Worker rejects payloads > 4MB
- R2 bucket is not publicly accessible — all access via Worker binding only
- All client-Worker traffic over HTTPS (enforced by Cloudflare)
- No PII collected: no names, emails, phone numbers, or user accounts

### Reliability

- Primary LLM (Gemini) failure triggers automatic Groq fallback with no user action required
- App shell loads from service worker cache when offline; scan page displays "Network required for scanning"
- Worker returns a structured error response within 10 seconds even if all LLM providers fail
- CI/CD pipeline blocks deployment if unit or E2E tests fail

### Scalability

- POC infrastructure stays within free-tier limits: Cloudflare Worker ≤100,000 req/day; R2 ≤10GB / ≤1M write ops/month; Gemini ≤1,500 req/day
- No scaling configuration required at POC scale (< 500 users/month) — serverless handles it inherently
- Architecture accommodates 10× user growth post-POC without structural changes

### Accessibility

- All interactive elements: WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1
- All touch targets: ≥ 44×44px
- All error and status messages conveyed via text (not color or icon alone)
- Result values (fill %, volume, nutrition) rendered as text — screen reader compatible
- Camera permission denied state includes plain-language grant instructions

### Compatibility

- iOS Safari 17+ (browser mode): full functionality — camera, fetch, service worker
- Android Chrome 120+: full functionality including PWA install prompt
- Android Firefox 120+: full functionality
- Desktop Chrome/Firefox/Edge: functional for dev and QA
- App detects iOS standalone mode and prompts "Open in Safari" to avoid WebKit camera bug
